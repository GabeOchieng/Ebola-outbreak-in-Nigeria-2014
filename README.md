# System Dynamics: Ebola outbreak in Nigeria 2014

Differential equations are an invaluable tool for modelling and analysis of complex systems. 
In System Dynamics terminology they model stocks and flows. 
Unfortunately, their handling is not trivial and outside academia it is not very common to make use of it. 
However, with just a few lines of code it is possible to plot the functions which allows a straightforward interpretation of the interdependencies.

Based on the information in this paper the outbreak has been modelled using Python.
